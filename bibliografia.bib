	abstract="In this chapter certain approximations of sets are considered which are very useful for the formulation of optimality conditions. We investigate so-called tangent cones which approximate a given set in a local sense. First, we discuss several basic properties of tangent cones, and then we present optimality conditions with the aid of these cones. Finally, we formulate a Lyusternik theorem.",
